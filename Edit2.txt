Misunderstood the question a second time ._.
We have 121 250 blocks at the bitmap
So we assume 121 249 blocks for the linked list.
121 249 * 255 = 30 918 459 blocks
121 249 addressblocks can save 10 918 459 datablocks.
So if we have 30 918 459 free blocks left, the linked list uses less space than the bitmap
